# The Snake Game - Documentation

This project is a classic Snake Game implemented in Python using the Turtle graphics module. The game is interactive, and the player controls the snake's movement to eat food, grow longer, and avoid collisions with the walls or its own tail.

## Features

- **Dynamic Gameplay**: The snake grows longer each time it eats food.
- **Collision Detection**: The game ends when the snake collides with the walls or its own tail.
- **Scoreboard**: The score is displayed at the top of the screen and increases as the snake eats food.
- **Customizable Gameplay**: Adjust the screen size, snake speed, and other parameters easily.

## How It Works

1. **Snake Movement**: The snake is made up of segments that follow the head. The player can control the direction of the head using arrow keys.
2. **Food**: A small circle appears randomly on the screen. When the snake's head collides with the food, the snake grows longer, and the score increases.
3. **Game Over**: The game ends if:
   - The snake collides with the walls.
   - The snake's head collides with its body.

## File Structure

- **game_code.py**: The main script to initialize and run the game.
- **food.py**: Contains the `Food` class to manage food behavior.
- **scoreboard.py**: Contains the `Scoreboard` class to display and update the player's score.
- **snake.py**: Contains the `Snake` class to handle the snake's movement and growth.

## Controls

- **Arrow Keys**:
  - `Up Arrow`: Move up
  - `Down Arrow`: Move down
  - `Left Arrow`: Move left
  - `Right Arrow`: Move right

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository or download the files.
3. Run the `game_code.py` file:
   ```bash
   python game_code.py
   ```
4. Use the arrow keys to control the snake and enjoy the game!

## Customization

- **Screen Size**: Modify the `screen.setup(width, height)` in `game_code.py` to change the game window size.
- **Snake Speed**: Adjust the `time.sleep()` value in the main game loop to increase or decrease the snake's speed.
- **Food Appearance**: Change the color or size of the food in the `Food` class in `food.py`.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Turtle module (pre-installed with Python)
