# Password Manager - Documentation

This project is a simple password manager implemented in Python using the Tkinter module for the graphical user interface.

## Features

- **Password Generation**: Automatically generates strong passwords with a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols.
- **Clipboard Copying**: Copies the generated password to the clipboard for easy pasting.
- **Data Storage**: Saves website credentials (website, email, and password) in a JSON file.
- **User-Friendly UI**: Simple and interactive interface built with Tkinter.
- **Password Retrieval**: Search for stored passwords by website name.

## How It Works

1. **Generate Password**: Click the "Generate Password" button to create a strong password.
2. **Enter Details**: Fill in the website and email fields.
3. **Save Password**: Click the "Add" button to store credentials in a JSON file.
4. **Clipboard Copy**: The generated password is automatically copied to the clipboard.
5. **Search Password**: Enter a website name and click "Search" to retrieve saved credentials.

## File Structure

- **main.py**: The main script that runs the password manager.
- **logo.png**: Image used for UI representation.
- **data.json**: File where saved credentials are stored in JSON format.

## UI Controls

- **Website Entry**: Enter the website name.
- **Email Entry**: Enter the email/username associated with the account.
- **Password Entry**: Displays the generated password.
- **Generate Password Button**: Creates a random password and inserts it into the password field.
- **Search Button**: Finds stored credentials for a website.
- **Add Button**: Saves the entered details to the JSON file.
